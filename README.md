# Logistic Regression (sklearn in Python)
Please visit my **.pdf files** for some theoretical explanations

In **code.py** you will see:

- Implementation of **Logistic Regression from "scikit-learn"** in Python

- **Cross-Validation** of the model

- **Standardization** and **Normalization** of the features before fitting the model

- Creating new features with **Polynomial Features** algorithm

- **Optimization** of the model parameters with **"GridSearchCV"**
