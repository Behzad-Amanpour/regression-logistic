# Logistic Regression (sklearn in Python)
Please visit my **.pdf files** for some theoretical explanations

In **code.py** you will see:

- Simple implementation of **Logistic Regression from "scikit-learn"** in Python

- **"Cross-Validation"** of the model

- **Standardization** and/or **Normalization** of the features before fitting the model

- Creating new features with **"Polynomial Features"** algorithm

- **Optimization** of the model parameters with **"GridSearchCV"**
