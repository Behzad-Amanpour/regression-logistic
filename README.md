# Logistic Regression ( sklearn & statsmodels in Python)
Please visit my **.pdf files** for some theoretical explanations

In **code.py** you will see:

- Simple implementation of logistic regression from "scikit-learn" in Python

- How to use "Cross-Validation" for the evaluation of the model

- How to standardize and/or normalize the features before fitting the model

- How to create new features with "Polynomial Features" algorithm

- How to optimize the parameters of the model
